**Figure 1. Global distribution of the Balance Index 2.0 (BI2).** Map of BI2 by country (lower = better alignment). Quantile bins; grey = missing/excluded per QC. Source: results/source_data/F1_world_map_source.csv.

**Figure 2. BI2 vs employment (scatter with 95% CI band).** Employment stored as 0–1 share. OLS fit with robust SEs; bootstrap CI (B=10,000; seed=2025). Source: results/source_data/F2_correlation_source.csv.

**Figure 3. Regional means with bootstrap CIs.** Mean BI2 and employment by region; error bars show bootstrap 95% CIs. Source: results/source_data/F3_regional_means_source.csv.

**Figure 4. Temporal window sensitivity (2018–2020 vs 2021–2024).** Pearson r between BI2 and employment by window; bars show r with 95% CIs. Source: results/source_data/F4_time_window_source.csv.
