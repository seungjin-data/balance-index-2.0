You may skip this if you will immediately add a CSV below (GitHub will create the folder automatically).

5-B) Figure 1 — World Map (source data)

Path: results/source_data/F1_world_map_source.csv
Paste:
iso3,country,year,bi2,region,is_imputed
EGY,Egypt,2024,0.017,Africa,0
MEX,Mexico,2024,0.020,North America,0
FIN,Finland,2024,0.023,Europe,0
Notes

bi2 = Balance Index 2.0 (symmetric KL; non-negative).

Store shares/indices as numbers, not formatted strings.

Replace rows with your final country list before submission.

Suggested commit message
data(source): add F1_world_map_source.csv (BI2 by country for world map)

5-C) Figure 2 — Correlation (BI2 vs Employment)

Path: results/source_data/F2_correlation_source.csv
Paste:
country,iso3,year,bi2,employment_rate,region
Germany,DEU,2024,0.449,0.884,Europe
Latvia,LVA,2024,0.523,0.816,Europe
Burkina Faso,BFA,2024,5.219,0.714,Africa
Notes

employment_rate stored as 0–1 (e.g., 0.884 = 88.4%).

Use this file to regenerate the scatter, regression line, and statistics.
data(source): add F2_correlation_source.csv (BI2 vs employment)

5-D) Table 1 — Country Rankings

Path: results/source_data/T1_country_rankings_source.csv
Paste:
rank,country,iso3,year,bi2,employment_rate,region,is_imputed,notes

Notes

Sort by bi2 ascending (lower = better alignment).

Keep is_imputed consistent with your imputation policy.

Suggested commit message
data(source): add T1_country_rankings_source.csv (journal source data for Table 1)
5-E) Optional (good practice, if used in the manuscript)
Figure 3 — Regional Means

Path: results/source_data/F3_regional_means_source.csv
Paste:
region,year,mean_bi2,mean_employment_rate,n_countries
Europe,2024,0.156,0.857,20
Asia,2024,0.289,0.781,6
Africa,2024,2.618,0.778,2

Commit message
data(source): add F4_time_window_source.csv (temporal sensitivity)
5-F) Formatting & QA rules (apply to all files)

Encoding: UTF-8; Delimiter: comma.

Units: store rates as 0–1; convert to % only in manuscript figures/tables.

Decimals: keep consistent precision (e.g., 3 decimals for rates, 3 for BI2).

IDs: include iso3 for robust joins; keep year consistent across files.

Validation: no empty headers; no mixed types in a column; avoid thousands separators.
